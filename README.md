QTCIDE
======

QT based C and C++ Visual Drag and Drop IDE

Developing code in C and C++ has many benefits, such as increased
speed and useful embedded functionality.

One of the bigger hurdles I found to using it was how verbose
and difficult to read my source files were becomming. In order
to improve speed of development and general program deployment,
it will have drag and drop functionality as well as built in
third party library management, build system and documentation
funcitonality.
