QTCIDE
======

QT based C and C++ Visual Drag and Drop IDE

Developing code in C and C++ has many benefits, such as increased
speed and useful embedded functionality.

One of the bigger hurdles I found to adopting C and C++ is how 
verbose and difficult to read my source files after a fair
amount of development and due to general style of the files.

In order to improve speed of development and general program 
deployment, this system will have drag and drop functionality 
as well as built in third party library management, 
build system integration, consistent styling options and 
automatic documentation generation.
