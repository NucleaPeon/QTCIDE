TODO 

* Develop a contextual set of signals that track state of project elements
  (Whether project is saved, disable / enable things whether saved or not)
* Create Window for adding and configuring project actions (configure should reuse part of the add compiler widget/window)
* Add run settings to the project when saved

* Ensure a Hello World C++ program can be created in as many ways as the IDE allows by default
  (Build system must work, basic testing suite must work, makefile and gcc configuration must work (to some degree))
  (Installation must work, eventually a debian package must work)
* Sphinx doc generation and viewer from the IDE (both FOR the IDE, and attach to projects)

* Templates: Objects that can be draggable, such as a Class, but contain code and/or default objects to produce a complete work.
  Example: Draggable "Factory" object for producing objects, "Logging" objects for writing.
  These objects should be disctinctly different from built in ones.
